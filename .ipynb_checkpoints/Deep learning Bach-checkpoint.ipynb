    "# Deep learning Bach. A step-by-step guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to merge two of my great passions: for Artificial Intelligence and for Bach music and try to guide You step-by-step through creating a computer system, which by examining Bach's collected works learns itself to compose \"like Bach\"... Seriously, at the end of this tutorial you will have a working artificial composer and hopefuly you will also understand how and why it works. And I am not going to lie to you: similar systems of course already exist, created by very smart university and corporate reserchers, but also by hobbyists.\n",
    "\n",
    "We live in exciting times. Amount of data available on-line in public domain is incredible and tools that allow to manipulate that data in really interesting ways (read: Machine Learning) matured. One thing in all of that is really to be thankful for: somehow the idea of sharing prevails and lot of extremely valuable stuff just lies there, waiting to be used and very smart people spend incredible amounts of their time making even more stuff publicly available and understandable. Kudos. I owe them. Hence this guide.\n",

    "1. We will start by creating a workbench we're going to use.\n",
    "2. Then we need to get a lot of example data to teach our composer\n",
    "3. Understand the data enough to make it useful\n",
    "4. Prepare it so it's suitable for ML\n",
    "5. Build a neural network\n",
    "6. And teach it using the data we prepared\n",
    "7. Paradoxically, this is not the end. We now need to uncover all that innate knowledge and make it express itself in writing\n",
    "8. Now, let's try to ask it to compose something for us\n",
    "9. Turn that partiture into playable MIDI file and...\n",
